Weâ€™re excited to announce additional checks that AccessLint now runs to help you
and your team prevent even more accessibility issues from reaching your
customers. The next time you open a Pull Request, AccessLint will review your
code to check that:

- Buttons have accessible text
- Values of the `lang` attribute on the `html` element are valid
- Attributes that start with `aria-` are [valid
  <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr>
  attributes][aria-attributes]
- Values of the [ARIA `role` attribute][aria-roles] are valid

A common mishap made by those both familiar with and new to ARIA is accidental
misspelling of attribute names and values. Given the vast landscape of the ARIA
specification, this isnâ€™t much of a surprise (is it `aria-role` or `role`? [^1]).
With AccessLint, you and your team can work fast and be confident that these
small blunders wonâ€™t slip in over time.
